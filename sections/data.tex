\section{Data Source}
\label{sec:Data}
In order to conduct rigorous analysis of the UK labour market, a large sample size is required. Due to the low proportion of ethnic minority groups in the UK population, a dataset with a very large combined sample size is imperative. Initially, the \acrfull{bcs} 1970 was preferred. However, due to the vast majority of participants being White, the sample of ethnic minority groups was insufficient. Additionally, wage data within the \acrshort{bcs} is limited, causing the overall sample from ethnic minorities with wage data to be very limited. Consequently, the \acrfull{lfs} is the main source of data for subsequent analysis.

The \acrshort{lfs} was initially a bi-annual survey of UK households, first conducted in 1973. In 1984 it became an annual survey, and since 1992 it has been conducted quarterly. The \acrshort{lfs} is the largest of its kind in the UK, and used for official UK statistics regarding both employment and unemployment \citep{ONS}. It covers approximately 40,000 households and 100,000 individuals in each quarter, with each household being interviewed for 5 waves (quarters). The period covered will be 1997 through to 2019. Only those in wave 1 have been kept to remove attrition bias and because changes in wages from wave 1 to 5 is expected to be minimal (which would generate serial-correlation from clustering). Reliable earnings data, not subject to attrition bias, is only available from 1997 \citep{ONSa}. At the time of writing, only three quarters of the 2020 data are available, resulting in reduced numbers of minorities. In addition, there are biases in responses due to social distancing and removal of face-to-face interviews; whilst weights have been adjusted, this analysis in this paper has not used (income) weights \citep{ONSb}. 

There are a number of drawbacks of using the \acrshort{lfs}. Firstly, it does not include past labour market experience, meaning that detailed analysis of periods out of the labour market cannot be conducted. Secondly, 2001-Q1 is a corrupted file on the UK Data Service, and so is excluded from the analysis, consistent with \citet{Longhi}. Finally, there is a high proportion of proxy responses, which can bias the likelihood of reporting certain qualities \citep{Clarke} and \citep{Davies}. However the effect on this paper's conclusions are believed to be minimal. Despite these drawbacks, the \acrshort{lfs} is the best one in the UK and the richest dataset, due to the large sample size and the ability to conduct analysis across time.

To enrich the dataset, regional unemployment data was pooled from \acrlong{ons} \citep{ONSf} with data regarding British attitudes coming from the \acrfull{us} survey, which was available in waves 1, 3 and 6 \citep{US}. This was merged with the \acrshort{lfs} dataset to enrich the predictive power of the model, and all forthcoming analysis uses this merged dataset, unless otherwise stated. In total, 12 million observations are pooled which, when reduced to those who were employed in wave 1, reduces the sample to 1 million. Keeping only observations with data for both hourly wages and each of the explanatory variables reduces the sample size to 515,980. This is comprised of 497,144 (93.28\%) White workers, 10,096 who are Black (1.89\%), 1,874 Chinese (0.35\%), 20,265 who are  Asian but not Chinese (3.80\%), and 3,585 (0.67\%) who are Mixed race. No other ethnic minorities are included in the sample.

\subsection{Setup}
\label{sec:Setup}
To conduct the analysis, hourly wages have been used, to eliminate the differences in weekly hours worked and the income effect of increased hourly wages. This increases accuracy but loses 12.6\% of the sample compared to weekly wages. Net wages are more likely to be accurately reported, but gross wages have been used to remove any effects of tax changes. Wages have also been deflated using the GDP deflator \citep{ONSh} so that controlling for time more accurately depicts any changes in the labour market over time which affect minorities in differential ways. 

The approximate experience, 'age minus years of education' has been used. This is relatively accurate for men, who are less likely to take time out of the labour market or be employed part-time \citep{Olsen}. However, there is a scarring effect of prolonged non-full time work (contributing to 52\% of the simulated pay gap), which is likely to have biased my findings for women (see further discussion by \citet{Walby}). Consequently, whilst \citet{Olsen} suggests that separating male/female analysis is wholly unrealistic in implying that there are separate labour markets for males and females, the differing labour market outcomes \citep{GOVa} and the lack of \acrshort{lfs} data on labour market history merit this. Any differences in continuous employment for across ethnicities will therefore be encompassed within the \enquote{unexplained} portion.

The literature suggests that labour market outcomes for immigrants (49\% of minorities in the sample) are starkly different to native minorities (\citet{Brynin}, \citet{ONSe} and \citet{Shields}), so it is important to control for the number of years in the UK. This is simply the age for natives, but for immigrants it uses the year of arrival in Britain, combined with the age and year of interview. Thus there can be inaccuracies depending on the months of interview, arrival, and respondent’s birthday. These issues are thought to be relatively insignificant, and the same as those faced by \citet{Berthoud}.

All of the UK except Northern Ireland have been included, due to clustering in London and SE, with only 0.6\% of the sample living in Northern Island. Additionally, the ethnicity question is not comparable between NI and the rest of the UK \citep{Longhi}.

Due to the dataset covering 23 years, there are a number of discrepancies in pooling the data in a consistent way. Years 1992-1996 were initially considered, but later dropped because many variables substantially differed from more recent years, some key data wasn't included, and earnings questions prior to 1997 were commonly unanswered. Most variables were relatively unchanged from 2001 onwards, with 1997-2000 converting suitable alternative variables. Notable exceptions include industry and occupation data, with industry data using an approximate conversion to the 1992 classification. Education data was also complex to make comparable categories, particularly prior to 1996, leading to education being condensed into 4 levels: under 5 (or 0) GCSEs at grade C, 5 GCSEs at grade C or above, 2 or more A Levels (or equivalent), an undergraduate degree. For more information see \hyperref[sec:appendixE]{Appendix E}. \textcolor{red}{possibly move some of this to the appendix??}

\subsection{Methods}
\label{sec:Methods}
Various methods have been used in the literature to analyse the pay gap. Whilst \citet{Barsky} notes that there are some situations where the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition can be misleading, \citet{Olsen} uses simulation, citing unobserved factors, but arrives at similar conclusions to the Oxacaca decompositions. \citet{Longhi} notes that Oaxaca is more reliable if the covariates of the two groups being compared have significant overlap, which is the case with the large sample size being considered in this paper. The Blinder-Oaxaca decompositions also allow the contributions to the pay gap to be explored in great detail, and as such is used for the majority of the analysis.  \textcolor{red}{more on oaxaca}

Furthermore, a raw household unique identifier is only included in Stata datasets from 2001-Q3 onwards. Consequently, all analysis will be conducted without clustering, in order to keep 1997-2001 within the analysis. The effect of this will be discussed in the 'sensitivity analysis' section (Section \ref{sec:sensitivity}), to assess whether there is a significant impact on any conclusions.

\subsection{Labour Market Outcomes}
\label{sec:Labour Market Outcomes}
Given that wages are the primary focus of this paper, only employed workers are included in the analysis (see Section \ref{sec:Setup}). It is important to first understand the wider labour market conditions in the sample. Figure \ref{fig:u_rates} depicts the unemployment rates for each ethnicity, with Whites being the least likely to be unemployed. Only Chinese workers had a lower unemployment rate at times over the sample period. Note that Black and Mixed race workers had the highest unemployment rates over the entirety of the sample, although all minorities saw unemployment rates fall over the sample period.

\end{subfigure}

\label{fig:labour_market}
\end{figure}

One of the reasons for the relatively low unemployment rate for Chinese workers is the high proportion of inactive workers. Figure \ref{fig:employment_stacked} shows that 37.4\% of the Chinese sample were inactive on average over the sample period. This may be due to workers becoming discouraged, or cultural norms, given that the female inactivity rate was 42.1\% compared to 31.9\% for men. Additionally, 10.5\% were self-employed, the highest of any ethnic grouping, possibly explaining the low unemployment rate.

The heterogeneity between Chinese and Asian (other) is important to note. Both have similar labour market characteristics, but the reasons for these are starkly different. Chinese workers are much less likely to have 2 or more children (17.0\% compared to 32.7\%). Additionally, Asian women have stubbornly high inactivity rates in the 30-39 age bracket relative to 16-21, with the falling to just 0.65, compared to 0.45-0.55 for most other ethnicities. This, combined with the greater number of children, on average, is evidence of heterogeneity in labour market histories for women (possibly due to discouragement during teenage years and early twenties). Consequently, any effects of numbers of children will be contained in the \enquote{explained} part of the analysis, with any behaviours in response to this which differ by ethnicity will bias the \enquote{unexplained} portion upwards.

Furthermore, Figure \ref{fig:employment_stacked} shows that Black and Mixed race workers both had some of the lowest inactivity rates, yet high unemployment rates. This may be due to a willingness to work, but difficulty in obtaining employment. It is also notable how both groups had the lowest self-employed rates among the sample. Consequently, the following analysis is likely to have underestimated the pay gap, given that the \acrshort{lfs} contains no self-employed wage data, which is typically lower than median wages \citep{GOVf}.

Structural unemployment in areas which house clusters of minorities could be a factor causing the higher levels of inactivity and unemployment (\citet{Platt} and \citet{Berthoud}). Whilst this varies for males relatively to females, minorities are consistently underrepresented in the labour market, particularly Chinese males and Asian women \citep{Longhi2}. Figure \ref{fig:population_by_ethnicity} shows how there is significant clustering in areas of the UK. Affluent areas have a low Black population, whereas metropolitan and cosmopolitan areas have much higher levels. This may explain why minority ethnic groups face higher levels of unemployment, possibly structurally, due to clustering geographical areas. Any such clustering is also likely to affect wages, through occupational clustering, a possible mechanism for the endogienety explored in Section \ref{sec:Literature}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Wages}
\label{sec:Wages}
An initial view of median hourly wages reveals vast disparities. Table \ref{tab:hourly_percentiles} contains figures for both male and female workers, at various percentiles, showing that the pay gap for males and females is much bigger at the higher end of the distribution. Male Black workers particularly struggle to reach particularly high paying jobs, unlike Black females. The lowest 10\% of Black females earn £0.68 more per hour than White females. Across the board, the distribution is much more even for women, with White females earning one of the lowest hourly wages. Significant heterogeneity within ethnic groups is observed - however, analysis at different points of the distribution is beyond the scope of this paper. Although, this can be seen with lowest 10\% of Chinese Male earners being significantly disadvantaged, earning just £6.13 per hour, yet the highest 10\% earn more than any other ethnic grouping. The converse is true for Black females.

Whilst similar proportions of the working population work full time relative to part time for each minority (24-27\%), the earnings profiles reveal important features of the labour market. These features corroborate the method of splitting male and female analysis and add to the literature surrounding the gender wage gap. Among full time earners, women earn a higher hourly wage in the 16-17 age bracket, and similar amounts until the age of 40, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:earnings_profiles}. However, beyond the age of 40, the reversal in earnings is much more pronounced than for males. This could be due to the reintroduction of mothers into the labour market who accept a lower wage, skewing the median wage downwards. Interestingly, this effect is less pronounced among part time workers, even in percentage terms, . This could be because part time workers, the majority of whom are women, are less likely to receive pay rises and are more concentrated near the minimum wage (\citet{IFS} and \citet{ONSi}).

    \label{fig:earnings_profiles}
\end{figure}

To provide the backdrop for analysis of discrimination in the labour market, it is important to explore trends in income for each ethnicity. Figure \ref{fig:median_wages} shows how median hourly wages have been increasing for each ethnic group. Asian workers have consistently been paid less than Whites, with those who are Black initially earning the same as those who are White, but earning less after the financial crisis of 2008. Chinese workers similarly earned the same as Whites, but have accelerated in earnings growth since. Finally, those of Mixed Race have earned similar amounts to White workers, with some periods above and some periods below the median White wage. Note that the Chinese and Mixed Race time series are significantly more volatile, which is believed to be due to the smaller sample size. However, Figure \ref{fig:median_wages} plots median wages, which will minimise the effects of outliers from year to year. Exploring why these earning differentials exist is the subject of the preceding chapters; it may be due to different characteristics, or outright pay discrimination.

\textcolor{red}{compare sample to the UK population - by gender, ethnicity and SIC2D. Also look at the dataset and liklihood of being married and having a degree etc - different levels of education, as this might fill some of the research that was recommended in \citep{Longhi2} on page 81 (101 for adobie pdf viewer).
This can be symptomatic of self-selection into industries, as seen with the equilibria of signalling models (or tase-based ones??).
