\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Racial wage discrimination became illegal in the UK in 1965 \citep{GOV} with the Race Relations Act, in light of increased immigration after WWII. The law was later strengthened in 1968 and 1976 \citep{Sooben}. Yet despite criticism of the legislation in the wake of the Brixton riots of 1981 \citep{Solomos}, the inadequacy of labour market protections for ethnic minorities was not addressed until 2010 through the Equality Act \citep{Brown}. Recent criticism of economic models by \citet{Spriggs} showed the need for a more objective approach to discrimination research. With little recent research into ethnic pay gaps, unlike gender pay gaps \citep{Metcalf}, and even less research into how they have changed over time, this paper seeks to address this.

Pay gaps can occur in two main ways. Either employers directly pay minorities a lower wage for the same job, or workers self-select into an (often lower-paid) occupation. The former is less likely, with the latter causing minorities to cluster into often lower-paid jobs. This itself can be due to the avoidance of occupations that are discriminatory, or due to historical pay discrimination causing under-investment in skills and education. Consequently, pay gaps emerge and are often persistent, with many underlying factors at play, making policy solutions complex.

In the next section, we explore economic models and theories which attempt to characterise aspects of the labour market, along with the literature surrounding ethnic pay gaps in the UK. Chapter \ref{sec:Data} outlines the details of data collection along with descriptive analysis, which provides the backdrop for decompositions and analysis of endowments. The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition technique is then outlined and implemented in Chapter \ref{sec:Analysis}, with a detailed discussion of the results. To conclude, Chapter \ref{sec:Limitations} discusses the limitations of the analysis along with areas for future research and finished by concluding with the main findings of this paper. Appendices can be found in Chapter \ref{sec:appendices}.

Amanda's meeting notes:
Change for occup and not industry. 
Similar for industry

Possibly higher status jobs are less racist. But probs not. 

Racist attitudes cause barriers to entry. Or like a tax on employment in a certain activity so pushed away.

Link with models of the Labour Market fit in with the results. 

Stratification researchers get annoyed when we model racism. If racism is structural then there's a lot of endogeniety.
